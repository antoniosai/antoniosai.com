# My Experience.

<!-- Start of Experience 1 -->

{{< tip >}}
_2015 - now_ - Freelance as Software Engineer

I have built a lot of applications using numerous technologies since 2015 for a variety of platforms, including: Web, Mobile, and Desktop. Unfortunately, though, I am unable to share the source code repository because we both agreed that the user owns the source code.

Projects: <strong><i>Inventory & Point Of Sales, Landing Pages, Learning Management System for School & College, Data Kependudukan Kab. Garut, Social Media Platform for Desa, Online Presence Web Based with Arduino + MQTT, Company Profiles, Gantt Chart Generator and so on.</i></strong>

_2022 March - Now_ - ICT Analyst

This was the time when I had my genuine journey. I worked on a fantastic project that involved fixing many problematic projects and applying Microservice technology because the circumstances called for it.

As an ICT Engineer, it is my obligation to create reusable applications with clean code and to work with the team to decide which technologies are and are not appropriate to utilize. Due to the fact that each application is created utilizing the most suitable technology, I am also more adaptable in this situation.
